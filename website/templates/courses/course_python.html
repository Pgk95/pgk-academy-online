        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Python is a popular programming language that is used for a variety of purposes, including web development,
            data science, and more. Python is a great language for beginners because it is easy to learn and has a
            simple syntax.

    <!-- Variables -->
    <section class="mt-4">
        <h2>Variables</h2>
        <p>
            Variables are used to store data in Python. Variables can be assigned a value using the equals sign (=).
            Variables can be named anything, but they cannot start with a number or contain spaces.
        </p>

        <pre>
<code class="python">
# Assigning a value to a variable
x = 5
</code>
        </pre>
    </section>
    <!-- Data Types -->
    <section class="mt-4">
        <h2>Data Types</h2>
        <p>
            Python has several built-in data types, including integers, floats, strings, booleans, and lists.
        </p>

        <pre>
<code class="python">
# Integer
x = 5

# Float
y = 5.5 

# String
x = "Hello, Python!"

# Boolean
x = True
y = False

# List
x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
</code>
        </pre>
    </section>
    <!-- Operators -->
    <section class="mt-4">
        <h2>Operators</h2>
        <p>
            Python has several built-in operators, including arithmetic, comparison, and logical operators.
        </p>

        <pre>
<code class="python">
# Arithmetic operators
x = 5 + 5
y = 5 - 5
z = 5 * 5
a = 5 / 5
b = 5 % 5
c = 5 ** 5

# Comparison operators
x = 5 == 5
y = 5 != 5
z = 5 > 5
a = 5 < 5
b = 5 >= 5
c = 5 <= 5

# Logical operators
x = True and True
y = True or False
z = not True

    <!-- Conditional Statements -->
    <section class="mt-4">
        <h2>Conditional Statements</h2>
        <p>
            Conditional statements are used to execute code based on a condition. Python has several built-in
            conditional statements, including if, elif, and else.
        </p>

        <pre>
<code class="python">
# If statement
x = 5
if x == 5:
    print("x is equal to 5")

# If-else statement
x = 5
if x == 5:
    print("x is equal to 5")
else:
    print("x is not equal to 5")

# If-elif-else statement
x = 5
if x == 5:
    print("x is equal to 5")
elif x == 6:
    print("x is equal to 6")
else:
    print("x is not equal to 5 or 6")

# Nested if statement
x = 5
if x == 5:

    if x == 6:
        print("x is equal to 6")
    else:
        print("x is not equal to 6")

else:
    print("x is not equal to 5")
